# Realtime Collaboration Skill - Description Draft 1

**Name**: realtime-collaboration

**Description**: Guides implementation of real-time collaborative features: cursor tracking, presence indicators, WebSocket synchronization for shared editing and multiplayer interfaces.

**Changes from v0**:
- Removed "in web applications" (too narrow - could apply to desktop apps)
- Changed "implements" to "guides implementation" (skill doesn't implement, it guides)
- Removed "Use when" clause - the feature list already makes trigger context clear
- Made list parallel structure without "and" before last item
