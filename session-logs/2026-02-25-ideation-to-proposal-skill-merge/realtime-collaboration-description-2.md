# Realtime Collaboration Skill - Description Draft 2

**Name**: realtime-collaboration

**Description**: Guides implementation of collaborative features: cursor tracking, presence indicators, WebSocket synchronization for shared editing and multiplayer interfaces.

**Changes from v1**:
- Removed "real-time" from description since it's in the name
- Kept the rest - description is now lean and every word adds value
