# Description Iteration 2

**Name**: ideation-to-proposal

**Description**: Two-phase ideation process: flexible exploration then structured validation with approval. Creates OpenSpec proposal documents before implementation.

---

## Changes from iteration 1:
- Removed "Guides" (weaker verb)
- Removed "of ideas" (implied by "ideation" in name)
- Moved "two-phase" to front (clearer structure)
- Simplified "flexible thinking followed by structured validation" → "flexible exploration then structured validation"
- Added "with approval" (addresses false negative - people looking for "approval")
- Moved "before implementation" to end (clearer causal flow)
- Tightened from 28 words to 18 words
